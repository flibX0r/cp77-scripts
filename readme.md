## Stuff I want to look in to

### Mods

- [ ] @Pseudodiego#0822 on Discord asked if I could look into pushing custom messages to the journal
- [ ] Steal the AR driving directions from Panam's questline/street races and add them to regular driving nav
- [ ] Extract fonts used in-game and generate a list of supported glyphs
- [ ] Half the shit rfuzzo posted in [#modding-ideas-requests](https://discord.com/channels/717692382849663036/835141343684198430/847012820314226689)

### Redscript compiler additions:

- [X] Add character escape sequences
- [X] Add `abstract` and `final` keyword support
- [ ] Add support for hex literals
- [ ] Add support for `enum == enum` conditional
- [ ] Add `struct` support (more complex than just a class flag)
- [ ] Add support for C-style `for`-loops (as syntactic sugar since that's how CDPR's compiler does them)
- [ ] Finish redscript mkdocs generator
